# What is one-click ingestion?

One-click ingestion makes the data ingestion process easy, fast, and intuitive. One-click ingestion uses intuitive UX to help you ramp-up quickly and start ingesting data and creating database tables and mapping structures.  Select data from different kinds of sources in different data formats, either as a one-time or continuous ingestion process.

The following features make one-click ingestion so useful:

* Intuitive experience guided by the ingestion wizard
* Ingest data in a matter of minutes
* Ingest data from different kinds of sources: local file, blobs, and containers (up to 10,000 blobs)
* Ingest data in a variety of [formats](#file-formats)
* Ingest data into new or existing tables
* Table mapping is suggested to you and easy to change
* Table schema is automatically suggested and easy to change
* Continue ingestion easily and quickly from a container with Event Grid

One-click ingestion is particularly useful when ingesting data for the first time, or when your data's schema is unfamiliar to you.

## Prerequisites

* If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* Create [an Azure Data Explorer cluster and database](create-cluster-database-portal.md).
* Sign in to the [Azure Data Explorer Web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/) and [add a connection to your cluster](web-query-data.md#add-clusters).

## File formats

One-click ingestion supports ingesting a new table from source data in any of the following formats:
* JSON
* CSV
* TSV
* SCSV
* SOHSV
* TSVE
* PSV

## Ingest new data

The one-click ingestion wizard guides you through the one-click ingestion process.

* To access the one-click ingestion wizard from the **Welcome to Azure Data Explorer** home screen in your cluster, complete the first two steps (cluster creation and database creation) and then select **Ingest new data**.

* To access the wizard from the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/), right-click the **database** or **table** row in the left menu of the Azure Data Explorer web UI and select **Ingest new data (preview)**.

> [!NOTE]
> This section describes the wizard in general. The options you select depend on what data format you are ingesting, what kind of data source you are ingesting from, and whether you are ingesting into a new or existing table.
>
> For sample scenarios, see:
> * Ingest into [a new table from a container in CSV format](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md)
> * Ingest into an [existing table from a local file in JSON format](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md) 

<!-- TODO either change the local file tutorial to blob storage or create another one to show users how to do this-->

## One-click ingestion wizard

* The wizard guides you through the following options:
    * Ingest into an [existing table](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md)
    * Ingest into [a new table](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md)
    * Ingest data from:
      * Blob storage
      * [A local file](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md)
      * [A container](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md)

### Schema mapping

* The service automatically generates schema and ingestion properties, which you can change. You can use an existing mapping structure or create a new one, depending on if you're ingesting to a new or existing table.

* In the **Schema** tab, you can do the following actions:
    * Confirm the autogenerated compression type.
    * Choose the [format of your data](#file-formats). Different formats will allow you to make further changes:
        * Choose **JSON levels** to determine column division.
        * Choose whether or not your **CSV** data has a header.

### Editor window

In the **Editor** window, you can adjust data table columns as necessary. 
* On new columns, you can do the following actions:
    * **New column**
    * **Delete column**
    * **Sort ascending**
    * **Sort descending**
* On existing columns, you can do the following actions:
    * **Sort ascending**
    * **Sort descending**
    * **New column**

>[!NOTE]
> At any time, you can open the [command editor](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md#command-editor) above the **Editor** pane. In the command editor, you can view and copy the automatic commands generated from your inputs.

### Data ingestion

Once you have completed schema mapping and column manipulations, the ingestion wizard will start the data ingestion process. 

* When ingesting data from **non-container** sources:
    * The ingestion will take immediate effect.

* If your data source is a **container**:
    * Azure Data Explorer's [batching policy](kusto/management/batchingpolicy.md) will aggregate your data. 
    * After ingestion, you can download the ingestion report and review the performance of each blob that was addressed. 
    * You can choose to **Create continuous ingestion** and set up [continuous ingestion using Event Grid](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md#continuous-ingestion---container-only).
 
### Initial data exploration
   
After ingestion, the wizard gives you options to use **[Quick commands](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md#quick-queries-and-tools)** for initial exploration of your data.

## Next steps

* Decide if you'll use one-click ingestion to ingest data into [an existing table](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md) or [a new table](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md)
* [Query data in Azure Data Explorer Web UI](web-query-data.md)
* [Write queries for Azure Data Explorer using Kusto Query Language](write-queries.md)
