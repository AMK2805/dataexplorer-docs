# What is sample app generator?

One-click sample app generator allows to create a working sample app code tailored to your cluster and data in various languages and frameworks. The quick start application is a **self-contained and runnable** example app that demonstrates authenticating, connecting to, administering, ingesting data into and querying Azure Data Explorer using the pre-selected SDK. You can use it as a baseline to write your own first Kusto client application, altering the code as you go, or copy code sections out of it into your app. The app includes comments with tips on recommendations, coding best practices, links to reference materials and recommended TODO changes when adapting the code to your needs.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription. Create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Create [a cluster and database](create-cluster-database-portal.md).
* Sign in to the [Azure Data Explorer Web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/) and [add a connection to your cluster](web-query-data.md#add-clusters).

> [!NOTE]
> To enable access between a cluster and a storage account without public access (restricted to private endpoint/service endpoint) in different subnets of the same VNET, see [Create a Private Endpoint in your Azure Data Explorer cluster in your virtual network](vnet-create-private-endpoint.md).

## Access the one-click wizard

The one-click sample app generator wizard guides you through the one-click ingestion process.

* To access the wizard from the [Azure Data Explorer web UI](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/), use one of the following methods:

    * Select **Data** in the left pane. Within the **Data Management** page under Quick actions, select **Sample App**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/one-click-sample-app-generator/sample-app-generator-welcome.png" alt-text="Sample app generator from welcome to Azure Data Explorer.":::

    * Select **Data** in the left pane. Within the **Data Management** page, select **SDKs & Connectors** tab. Within SDKs sub-tab, select an SDK.

## One-click sample app generator wizard

On the Destination tab you can select the desired SDK for your app.

> [!NOTE]
> This section describes the wizard in general. The options you select depend on what data format you are ingesting, what kind of data source you are ingesting from, and whether you are ingesting into a new or existing table.
>
> For sample scenarios, see:
> * Ingest into [a new table from a Blob storage in CSV format](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md)
> * Ingest into an [existing table from a local file in JSON format](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md) 

The wizard guides you through the following options:
   * Ingest into an [existing table](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md)
   * Ingest into [a new table](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md)
   * Ingest data from:
      * Blob storage
      * [A local file](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md)

### Schema mapping

The service automatically generates schema and ingestion properties, which you can change. You can use an existing mapping structure or create a new one, depending on if you're ingesting to a new or existing table.

In the **Schema** tab, do the following actions:
   * Confirm the autogenerated compression type.
   * Choose the [format of your data](#file-formats). Different formats will allow you to make further changes.
   * Change mapping in the [Editor window](#editor-window).

#### File formats

One-click ingestion supports ingesting from source data in all [data formats supported by Azure Data Explorer for ingestion](ingestion-supported-formats.md).

### Editor window

In the **Editor** window of the **Schema** tab, you can adjust data table columns as necessary. 

[!INCLUDE [data-explorer-one-click-column-table](includes/data-explorer-one-click-column-table.md)]

>[!NOTE]
> At any time, you can open the [command editor](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md#command-editor) above the **Editor** pane. In the command editor, you can view and copy the automatic commands generated from your inputs.

#### Mapping transformations

Some data format mappings (Parquet, JSON, and Avro) support simple ingest-time transformations. To apply mapping transformations, create or update a column in the [Editor window](#editor-window).

Mapping transformations can be performed on a column of **Type** string or datetime, with the **Source** having data type int or long. Supported mapping transformations are:
* DateTimeFromUnixSeconds
* DateTimeFromUnixMilliseconds
* DateTimeFromUnixMicroseconds
* DateTimeFromUnixNanoseconds

For more information, see [mapping transformations](#mapping-transformations).

### Code generator

Once you have completed schema mapping and column manipulations, the sample app generator wizard will start the code generation process. 
 
### Initial data exploration
   
After code generation, the sample app project will be available for download (as a ZIP file). Detailed instructions for running the project with the selected SDK will be shown both on the summary tab and inside the sample project file. In addition the wizard gives you options to use **[Quick commands](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md#explore-quick-queries-and-tools)** for initial exploration of your data

>[!NOTE]
> It is possible that the Quick commands may need the generated project to run at least once in order to run successfully (i.e. the project creates a new table).
