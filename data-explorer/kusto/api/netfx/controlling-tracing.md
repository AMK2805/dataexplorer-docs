# Controlling and suppressing Kusto SDK client-side tracing

The Kusto Client Libraries use a common platform for tracing. The platform uses a large number
of trace sources (`System.Diagnostics.TraceSource`), and each is connected to the default set of
trace listeners (`System.Diagnostics.Trace.Listeners`) during its construction.

If an application has trace listeners associated with the default `System.Diagnostics.Trace` instance
(for example, through its `app.config` file), then the Kusto Client Libraries will emit traces to
those listeners.

The tracing can be suppressed or controlled programmatically or through a config file.

## Suppress tracing programmatically

To suppress tracing from the Kusto client libraries programmatically, invoke this piece of code when loading
the relevant library:

```csharp
Kusto.Cloud.Platform.Utils.TraceSourceManager.SetTraceVerbosityForAll(
    Kusto.Cloud.Platform.Utils.TraceVerbosity.Fatal
    );
```

## Suppress tracing by using a config file

To suppress tracing from the Kusto client libraries through a config file, 
modify the file `Kusto.Cloud.Platform.dll.tweaks` (which is included with the `Kusto.Data` library).

```xml
    <!-- Overrides the default trace verbosity level -->
    <add key="Kusto.Cloud.Platform.Utils.Tracing.OverrideTraceVerbosityLevel" value="0" />
```

> [!NOTE]
> For the tweak to take effect, there must not be a minus sign in the value of `key`

An alternative, is:

```csharp
Kusto.Cloud.Platform.Utils.Anchor.Tweaks.SetProgrammaticAppSwitch(
    "Kusto.Cloud.Platform.Utils.Tracing.OverrideTraceVerbosityLevel",
    "0"
    );
```

## How to enable the Kusto client libraries tracing

To enable tracing out of the Kusto client libraries, enable .NET tracing
in your application's *app.config file*. For example, assume that the application
`MyApp.exe` uses the Kusto.Data client library. Changing file *MyApp.exe.config* to include the following, will enable `Kusto.Data` tracing the next time that the application starts.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
<configuration>
  <system.diagnostics>
    <trace indentsize="4">
      <listeners>
        <add type="Kusto.Cloud.Platform.Utils.RollingCsvTraceListener2, Kusto.Cloud.Platform" name="RollingCsvTraceListener" initializeData="RollingLogs" />
        <remove name="Default" />
      </listeners>
    </trace>
  </system.diagnostics>
</configuration>
```

The code will configure a trace listener that writes to CSV files in a subdirectory called *RollingLogs*. 
The subdirectory is located in the process' directory.

> [!NOTE]
> Any .NET-compatible trace listener class may be used as well

## How to enable the Azure AD client libraries (ADAL) tracing

Once tracing for the Kusto client libraries is enabled, so is the tracing by the Azure AD 
client libraries. The Kusto client libraries automatically configure ADAL tracing.
