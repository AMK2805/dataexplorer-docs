# Kusto Ping REST API

The ping REST API is provided to allow network devices such as load balancers
to verify simple network responsiveness of the cluster's stateless front-end
components. When a GET verb is applied to this endpoint the cluster responds
by returning a 200 OK HTTP response. The REST API is unauthenticated (the caller
does not need to send an HTTP `Authorization` header).

- Path: `/v1/rest/ping`
- Verb: `GET`
- Actions: Respond with a `200 OK` message
- Arguments: None
