Where *Action* represents a group of related activities.

* The Query action sends a query to the service and gets back the results of the query.
* The Management action sends a control command to the service and gets back
  the results of the control command.
* The UI action can be used to start up a desktop client or web client. The action is done through an HTTP Redirect response,
to interact with the service.

For more information on the HTTP request/response of the query and management actions, see [query management HTTP request](./request.md), [query management HTTP response](./response.md), and [query v2 HTTP response](./response2.md). 
For more information on the UI action, see [UI (deeplink)](./deeplink.md).
