# Stored functions

Stored functions are reusable queries that are stored as part of a database. Stored functions are a kind of 
[user-defined functions](../userdefinedfunctions.md), and have the same invocation syntax and rules. Unlike ad-hoc
user-defined functions (whose scope is that of a query), stored functions are full-fledged durable database entities, similar
to tables, and are supported by a similar array of [control commands](https://kusdoc2.azurewebsites.net/docs/controlCommands/controlcommands_functions.html).
