# dcount-hll()

Calculates the dcount from hll results (which was generated by [hll](hll-aggfunction.md) or [hll-merge](hll-merge-aggfunction.md)).

Read more about the underlying algorithm (*H*yper*L*og*L*og) and the estimated error [here](dcount-aggfunction.md#estimation-error-of-dcount).

**Syntax**

`dcount-hll(`*Expr*`)`

**Arguments**

* *Expr*: Expression which was generated by [hll](hll-aggfunction.md) or [hll-merge](hll-merge-aggfunction.md)

**Returns**

The distinct count of each value in *Expr*

**Examples**

```kusto
StormEvents
| summarize hllRes = hll(DamageProperty) by bin(StartTime,10m)
| summarize hllMerged = hll-merge(hllRes)
| project dcount-hll(hllMerged)
```
