# !hassuffix operators

Filters a record set based on a term suffix. Any data that doesn't contain a term with the suffix is retrieved from the searched column.

The following table provides a comparison of the `has` operators. For more information about other operators and to determine which operator is most appropriate for your query, see [datatype string operators](datatypes-string-operators.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The following abbreviations are used in the table below:
>
> * RHS = right hand side of the expression
> * LHS = left hand side of the expression
> 
> Operators with an `_cs` suffix are case sensitive.

|Operator   |Description   |Case-Sensitive  |Example (yields `true`)  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
|[`hassuffix`](hassuffix-operator.md) |RHS is a term suffix in LHS |No |`"North America" hassuffix "ica"`|
|[`!hassuffix`](not-hassuffix-operator.md) |RHS isn't a term suffix in LHS |No |`"North America" !hassuffix "americ"`|
|[`hassuffix_cs`](hassuffix-cs-operator.md)  |RHS is a term suffix in LHS |Yes |`"North America" hassuffix_cs "ica"`|
|[`!hassuffix_cs`](not-hassuffix-cs-operator.md) |RHS isn't a term suffix in LHS |Yes |`"North America" !hassuffix_cs "icA"`|

## Performance tips

For better performance, when there are two operators that do the same task, use the case-sensitive one. For example use `hassuffix_cs`, not `hassuffix`.

For faster results, if you're testing for the presence of a symbol or alphanumeric word that is bound by non-alphanumeric characters, or the start or end of a field, use `has` or `in`.
For more information, see [Query best practices](best-practices.md).

## Syntax

*T* `|` `where` *col* `!hassuffix` `(`*expression*`)`   

## Arguments

* *T* - The tabular input whose records are to be filtered.
* *col* - The column to filter.
* *expression* - Scalar or literal expression.

## Returns

Rows in *T* for which the predicate is `true`.

## Example

```kusto
StormEvents
    | summarize event_count=count() by State
    | where State !hassuffix "A"
    | where event_count > 2000
    | project State, event_count
```
