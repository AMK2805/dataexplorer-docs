# has operators

Filters a record set based on the provided value. The value represents a term found in the searched column.

The following table provides a comparison of the `has` operators. For further information about other operators and to determine which operator is most appropriate for your query, see [datatype string operators](datatypes-string-operators.md).

> [!NOTE]
> The following abbreviations are used in the table below:
>
> * RHS = right hand side of the expression
> * LHS = left hand side of the expression
> 
> Operators with an `_cs` suffix are case sensitive.

|Operator   |Description   |Case-Sensitive  |Example (yields `true`)  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
|[`has`](has-operator.md) |Right-hand-side (RHS) is a whole term in left-hand-side (LHS) |No |`"North America" has "america"`|
|[`!has`](not-has-operator.md) |RHS isn't a full term in LHS |No |`"North America" !has "amer"`|
|[`has_cs`](has-cs-operator.md) |RHS is a whole term in LHS |Yes |`"North America" has_cs "America"`|
|[`!has_cs`](not-has-cs-operator.md) |RHS isn't a full term in LHS |Yes |`"North America" !has_cs "amer"`|

## Performance tips

For better performance, when there are two operators that do the same task, use the case-sensitive one.
For example:

* Use `has_cs`, not `has`
* Use `in`, not `in~`
* Use `contains_cs`, not `contains`

For faster results, if you're testing for the presence of a symbol or alphanumeric word that is bound by non-alphanumeric characters, or the start or end of a field, use `has` or `in`. `has` works faster than `contains`, `startswith`, or `endswith`. 

For more information, see [Query best practices](best-practices.md).

## Syntax

### Case insensitive syntax

*T* `|` `where` *col* `has` `(`*expression*`)`   

## Arguments

* *T* - The tabular input whose records are to be filtered.
* *col* - The column to filter.
* *expression* - Scalar or literal expression.

## Returns

Rows in *T* for which the predicate is `true`.

## Examples

    | summarize event_count=count() by State
    | where State has "New"
    | where event_count > 10
    | project State, event_count
