# !endswith operator

Filters a record set for data that does not contain a case-insensitive ending string.

The following table provides a comparison of the `endswith` operators:

|Operator   |Description   |Case-Sensitive  |Example (yields `true`)  |
|-----------|--------------|----------------|-------------------------|
|[`endswith`](endswith-operator.md) |RHS is a closing subsequence of LHS |No |`"Fabrikam" endswith "Kam"`|
|[`!endswith`](not-endswith-operator.md) |RHS isn't a closing subsequence of LHS |No |`"Fabrikam" !endswith "brik"`|
|[`endswith_cs`](endswith-cs-operator.md) |RHS is a closing subsequence of LHS |Yes |`"Fabrikam" endswith_cs "kam"`|
|[`!endswith_cs`](not-endswith-cs-operator.md) |RHS isn't a closing subsequence of LHS |Yes |`"Fabrikam" !endswith_cs "brik"`|

> The following abbreviations are used in the table above:
>
> * RHS = right hand side of the expression
> * LHS = left hand side of the expression

For further information about other operators and to determine which operator is most appropriate for your query, see [datatype string operators](datatypes-string-operators.md). 

Case-insensitive operators are currently supported only for ASCII-text. For non-ASCII comparison, use the [tolower()](tolowerfunction.md) function.

## Performance tips

For faster results, use the case-sensitive version of an operator, for example, `endswith_cs`, not `endswith`.

If you're testing for the presence of a symbol or alphanumeric word that is bound by non-alphanumeric characters at the start or end of a field, for faster results use `has` or `in`. Also, `has` works faster than `contains`, `startswith`, or `endswith`, however it is not as precise and could provide unwanted records.

For best practices, see [Query best practices](best-practices.md).

## Syntax

*T* `|` `where` *col* `!endswith` `(`*expression*`)`   

## Arguments

* *T* - The tabular input whose records are to be filtered.
* *col* - The column to filter.
* *expression* - Scalar or literal expression.

## Returns

Rows in *T* for which the predicate is `true`.

    | summarize event_count=count() by State
    | where State !endswith "is"
    | where event_count > 2000
    | project State, event_count
```
