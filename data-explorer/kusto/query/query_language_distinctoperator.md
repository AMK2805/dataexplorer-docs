**Remarks**

There are two main semantic differences between the `distinct` operator and
using `summarize by ...`:
* Distinct supports providing an asterisk (`*`) as the group key, making it easier to use for wide tables.
* Distinct doesnâ€™t have auto-binning of time columns (to `1h`).

<!-- csl -->
```
let T=(print t=datetime(2008-05-12 06:45));
union
  (T | distinct * | extend Title="Distinct"),
  (T | summarize by t | extend Title="Summarize"),
  (T | summarize by bin(t, 1tick) | extend Title="Summarize-distinct")
		
	t	Title
	2008-05-12 06:00:00.0000000	Summarize
	2008-05-12 06:45:00.0000000	Distinct
	2008-05-12 06:45:00.0000000	Summarize-distinct
```

This query produces the following table:

t                            | Title
-----------------------------|--------------------
2008-05-12 06:45:00.0000000  | Distinct
2008-05-12 06:00:00.0000000  | Summarize
2008-05-12 06:45:00.0000000  | Summarize-distinct
