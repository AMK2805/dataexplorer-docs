Read more about the underlying algorithm (*H*yper*L*og*L*og) and the estimated error [here](query_language_dcount_aggfunction.md#estimation-error-of-dcount).

**Syntax**

`dcount_hll(`*Expr*`)`

**Arguments**

* *Expr*: Expression which was generated by [hll](query_language_hll_aggfunction.md) or [hll_merge](query_language_hll_merge_aggfunction.md)

**Returns**

The distinct count of each value in *Expr*

**Examples**


```
StormEvents
| summarize hllRes = hll(DamageProperty) by bin(StartTime,10m)
| summarize hllMerged = hll_merge(hllRes)
| project dcount_hll(hllMerged)
```
