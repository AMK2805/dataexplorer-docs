# Azure Pipelines

Azure Pipelines helps you easily implement a build, test, and deployment pipeline.

The "Admin Commands" task for Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) allows you to run multiple control
commands as part of your pipeline. These can either be specified inline, or as source control
paths to `csl` files.
