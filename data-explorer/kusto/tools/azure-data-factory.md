# Azure Data Factory

You can copy data from any supported source data store to Kusto, or copy data from Kusto to any
supported sink data store.

The Kusto connector allows you to do the following:
* Copy data by using Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) application token authentication with a service principal.
* As a source, retrieve data by using a KQL (Kusto) query.
* As a sink, append data to a destination table.
