# Kusto.Explorer tool

Kusto.Explorer is a rich desktop application that allows you to explore your data with Kusto. 

## Getting the tool

Installation is simple as accessing your Kusto cluster with Internet Explorer at:
[https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net](https://your_cluster.kusto.windows.net)

Alternatively, you can obtain a Kusto.Explorer tool from this URL: [https://aka.ms/Kusto.Explorer](https://aka.ms/Kusto.Explorer)



## Using Edge and Kusto.Explorer

> [!WARNING]
> There is a known regression in Windows 10 April 2018 (version 1803) that prevents
> Edge from opening deep-links to Kusto queries in Kusto.Explorer. The fix is planned
> to be available in Windows for summer 2018.

## Using Chrome and Kusto.Explorer

If you are using Chrome as your default browser - make sure to install the ClickOnce extension for Chrome:

## Connections Panel

![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/connectionsPanel.png "connections-panel") 

The left pane of Kusto.Explorer shows all the cluster connections that the client
is configured with, and for each cluster -- the databases, tables, and attributes (columns) 
that they store. The pane allows one to select items (which sets an implicit context
for the search/query in the main panel), or double-click items to copy the name to the
search/query panel.

If the actual schema is large (such as a database with hundreds of tables), it is possible to search the schema by typing CTRL+F and a 
substring (case-insensitive) of the entity name being looked-for.

Kusto.Explorer supports controlling the connection panel from the query window.
This is very useful for scripts, for example. Starting a script file with a command
that instructs Kusto.Explorer to connect to the cluster/database whose data is being
queries by the script is possible by using the following syntax (note that,
as usual, you'll have to run each line using `F5` or similar):

```kusto
#connect cluster('help').database('Samples')

StormEvents | count
```

## Search Beta Mode

1.  In the ribbon's Home -> Explore tab, click "Search (beta)"
2. Choose "Multiple tables" and then under "Choose tables" you can define which tables to search
3. In the edit box write your search phrase and hit "Go"
4. You will get a heat-map of table/time-slot grid showing which term appears where
5. Select a cell in the grid and click "View Details" to show the relevant entries

![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/ke-search-beta.jpg "ke-search-beta") 

## Query Mode

Kusto.Explorer has powerful script mode - that allows you write, edit and run ad-hoc queries. 
It comes with syntax highlighting and IntelliSense - so you can ramp-up to Kusto CSL
language very fast.

### Basic Queries
Assume you have table Logs. You can start exploring it by typing next:

```kusto
StormEvents | count 
```

When your cursor is positioned on this line - it is colored in gray - and pressing 'F5' will 
run the query. 

Some more queries:

```kusto
// Take 10 lines from the table. Useful to get familiar with the data
StormEvents | limit 10 
```
```kusto
// Filter by EventType == 'Flood' and State == 'California' (=~ means case insensitive) 
// and take sample of 10 lines
StormEvents 
| where EventType == 'Flood' and State =~ 'California'
| limit 10
```

## Importing a local file into a Kusto table

Kusto.Explorer provides a convenient way to upload a files from your machine to a Kusto table.

First, make sure you have created the table with a schema which matches your file
(e.g. using the [.create table](../management/tables.md) command)

Second, make sure the contents of your file match its extension. E.g.:
- If your file contains comma-separated-values, make sure your file is named "MyFile.csv".
- If your file contains tab-separated-values, make sure your file is named "MyFile.tsv".

Once the above are verified, follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the target database in the [Connections panel](#connections-panel), and select `Refresh`, so that your table appears.

    ![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/right-click-refresh-schema.png "right-click-refresh-schema")

2. Right-click on the target table in the [Connections panel](#connections-panel), and select `Import data from local files`.

    ![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/right-click-import-local-file.png "right-click-import-local-file")

3. Choose the file(s) you wish to be uploaded and select `Open`.

    ![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/import-local-file-choose-files.png "import-local-file-choose-files")

4. Follow the progress, until operation completes

    ![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/import-local-file-progress.png "import-local-file-progress")

    ![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/import-local-file-complete.png "import-local-file-complete")

5. Query the data in your table (double-click on the table in the [Connections panel](#connections-panel)).

## Managing Authorized Principals

Kusto.Explorer provides a convenient way to manage cluster, database, table or function authorized principals.

Please note that only [admins](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) can add or drop authorized principals in their own scope.

1. Right-click on the target entity in the [Connections panel](#connections-panel), and select `Manage Authorized Principals`
    (also available via the Management Menu).

    ![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/right-click-manage-authorized-principals.png "right-click-manage-authorized-principals")

    ![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/manage-authorized-principals-window.png "manage-authorized-principals-window")

2. In case you want to add a new authorized principal, select `Add principal`, provide the principal details and confirm the action.

    ![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/add-authorized-principals-window.png "add-authorized-principals-window")

    ![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/confirm-add-authorized-principals.png "confirm-add-authorized-principals")

3. In case you want to drop an existing authorized principal, select `Drop principal` and confirm the action.

    ![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/confirm-drop-authorized-principals.png "confirm-drop-authorized-principals")

## Sharing Queries and Results over Email

Kusto.Explorer provides a convenient way to share queries and query results over email -- Simply click "Export to Clipboard", and the tool will copy to the clipboard:
1. Your query
2. The query results (table or chart)
3. The connection details for the Kusto cluster and database
4. A link that will re-run the query automatically

Here's how it works:

1. Run some query in Kusto.Explorer
2. Click "Export to Clipboard" (or use `Ctrl+Shift+C` keystroke)

![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/menu-export.png "menu-export")

3. Switch to (for example) an Outlook Message:

![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/share-results.png "share-results")
    
4. Hit "Paste:":

![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/share-results-2.png "share-results-2")

## Parametrized Queries

If you plan to use same value in multiple queries or in multiple tabs, it is going to 
be hard to change it. Luckily, Kusto.Explorer supports having Query parameters. Parameters 
are denoted with {} brackets. For example: `{parameter1}`

Script editor highlights query parameters:

![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/parametrized-query-1.png "parametrized-query-1")

You can easily define/edit existing Query parameters:

![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/parametrized-query-2.png "parametrized-query-2")

![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/parametrized-query-3.png "parametrized-query-3")

Script editor also has IntelliSense for Query parameters that are already defined:

![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/parametrized-query-4.png "parametrized-query-4")

There can be multiple "sets" of parameters (listed in Parameters Set combo box).
Buttons, "Add new" and "Delete current" manipulate list of Parameters "sets".

![alt text](./Images/KustoTools-KustoExplorer/parametrized-query-5.png "parametrized-query-5")

Note that Query parameters are shared among tabs, so that they can be easily reused.

## Deep-linking queries

### Overview
It is possible to create a URI that, when opened in a browser, will have Kusto.Explorer 
start locally and run a specified query on the specified Kusto database.

### Limitations
The queries are limited to ~2000 chars due to IE limitation (the limitation is approximate because it is dependent on the cluster and Database name length)
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/208427 
To reduce chances you will hit this limitation - see the Getting Shorter Links paragraph on this page.

The format of the URI is this:
    https://<ClusterCname>.kusto.windows.net/<DatabaseName>?query=<QueryToExecute>
 
For example: 
    https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples?query=StormEvents+%7c+limit+10
 
This URI will open new Kusto.Explorer, connect to the ARIA Kusto cluster, and run the specified query on the specified database (whose name is some object ID in ARIA). (Unless there is an instance of Kusto.Explorer already running, in which case the running instance will open a new tab and run the query in it.)

**Security note**: For security reasons, deep-linking is disabled for control commands.



### Creating a Deep-Link: the Easy Way
The easiest way to create a deep-link is to author your query in Kusto.Explorer, and then use
the Export to Clipboard button to copy the query (plus the deep link and results) to the clipboard,
ready for sharing via Outlook:
        
When pasted to Outlook (or a similar app), the deep link is in small fonts; for example:

https://help.kusto.windows.net:443/Samples [[Click to run query](https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples?web=0&query=H4sIAAAAAAAEAAsuyS%2fKdS1LzSspVuDlqlEoLs3NTSzKrEpVSM4vzSvR0FRIqlRIyszTCC5JLCoJycxN1VEwT9EEKS1KzUtJLVIoAYolZwAlFQCB3oo%2bTAAAAA%3d%3d)] 

The first link opens Kusto.Explorer and sets the cluster/database context appropriately.
The second link ("Click to run query") is the deep link. If you move to the link in Outlook
and press CTRL-K, you can see the actual URL:

https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples?web=0&query=H4sIAAAAAAAEAAsuyS%2fKdS1LzSspVuDlqlEoLs3NTSzKrEpVSM4vzSvR0FRIqlRIyszTCC5JLCoJycxN1VEwT9EEKS1KzUtJLVIoAYolZwAlFQCB3oo%2bTAAAAA%3d%3d

### Deep-link and Parametrized Queries
It is possible to use Parametrized Queries with deep-linking.
First, make a query to be formed as Parametrized Query (e.g. KustoLogs | where Timestamp > ago({Period}) | count) 
Second, provide a parameter for every Query Parameter in the URI
In this case
https://mycluster.kusto.windows.net/MyDatabase?web=0&query=KustoLogs+%7c+where+Timestamp+>+ago({Period})+%7c+count&Period=1h

### Getting Shorter Links
Queries may become longer - and in order to reduce the chance query exceeds maximum length - you 
can use 
`String Kusto.Data.Common.CslCommandGenerator.EncodeQueryAsBase64Url(string query)` method 
available in Kusto Client Library that will produce a more compact version of the query and this 
format is also recognized by Kusto.Explorer

https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples?web=0&query=H4sIAAAAAAAEAAsuyS%2fKdS1LzSspVuDlqlEoLs3NTSzKrEpVSM4vzSvR0FRIqlRIyszTCC5JLCoJycxN1VEwT9EEKS1KzUtJLVIoAYolZwAlFQCB3oo%2bTAAAAA%3d%3d

How does making compact query work?
The query is made more compact by applying next transformation:

```csharp
 UrlEncode(Base64Encode(GZip(original query)))
```

## Kusto.Explorer command-line arguments

Kusto.Explorer supports accepting several command-line arguments in the following syntax (order matters):

[*LocalScriptFile*] [*QueryString*]

Where:
* *LocalScriptFile* is the name of a script file on the local machine which must
  have the extension `.csl`. If such file exists, Kusto.Explorer will automatically
  load this file when it starts up.
* *QueryString* is a string formatted using the HTTP query string formatting,
  which provides additional properties as described in the table below.

For example, to start Kusto.Explorer with a script file called `c:\temp\script.csl`
and configured to communicate with cluster `help`, database `Samples`, use the
following command:

```
Kusto.Explorer.exe c:\temp\script.csl uri=https://help.kusto.windows.net/Samples;Fed=true&name=Samples
```

|Argument  |Description                                                               |
|----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Query to execute**                                                                 |
|`query`   |The query to execute (base64-encoded); if empty, use `querysrc`.          |
|`querysrc`|The URL of a file/blob holding the query to execute (if `query` is empty).|
|**Connection to the Kusto cluster**                                                  |
|`uri`     |The connection string of the Kusto cluster to connect to.                 |
|`name`    |The display name of the connection to the Kusto cluster.                  |
|**Connection group**                                                                 |
|`path`    |The URL of a connection group file to download (URL-encoded).             |
|`group`   |The name of the connection group.                                         |
|`filename`|The local file holding the connection group.                              |

## Kusto.Explorer connection files

Kusto.Explorer keeps its connections settings under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kusto.Explorer` folder.
List of Connection Groups is kept inside `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kusto.Explorer\UserConnectionGroups.xml`,
and each Connection Group is kept inside dedicated file under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kusto.Explorer\Connections\`.

### Format of Connection Group file

File location is at `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kusto.Explorer\UserConnectionGroups.xml`:  

This is an XML serialization of an array of the `ServerGroupDescription` objects with next properties:

```
  <ServerGroupDescription>
    <Name>`Connection Group name`</Name>
    <Details>`Full path to XML file containing the list of connections`</Details>
  </ServerGroupDescription>
```

#### Example of Connection Group file

```
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<ArrayOfServerGroupDescription xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">

    <Name>Connections</Name>
    <Details>C:\Users\alexans\AppData\Local\Kusto.Explorer\UserConnections.xml</Details>
  </ServerGroupDescription>
</ArrayOfServerGroupDescription>  
```

### Format of Connection list file

File location is under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kusto.Explorer\Connections\`:  

This is an XML serialization of an array of the `ServerDescriptionBase` objects with next properties:

```
   <ServerDescriptionBase xsi:type="ServerDescription">
    <Name>`Connection name`</Name>
    <Details>`Details as shown in UX, usually full URI`</Details>
    <ConnectionString>`Full connection string to the cluster`</ConnectionString>
  </ServerDescriptionBase>
```

In some cases you might need to completely reset Kusto.Explorer. The following procedure can be used to progressively reset Kusto.Explorer deployed on your computer, until it is completely removed and must be installed from scratch.

1. Open `Change or remove a program` (also known as `Programs and Features`),
   then select every item whose name starts with `Kusto.Explorer` and hit `Uninstall`.

   If this fails to uninstall the application (a known issue sometimes with
   ClickOnce applications), please see [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10896223/how-do-i-completely-uninstall-a-clickonce-application-from-my-computer).

2. Delete the folder `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kusto.Explorer`. (NOTE: This removed all connections that you might have, history, etc..)

3. Delete the folder `%APPDATA%\Kusto`. (NOTE: This removes the Kusto.Explorer token cache; you will need to re-authenticate to all cluster.)

It is also possible to "go back" to a specific version of Kusto.Explorer:

1. Run `appwiz.cpl`
2. Select `Kusto.Explorer` and hit `Uninstall/Change`
3. Select `Restore the application to its previous state`

```

*Proposed solution steps:*
 
1.	Uninstall Kusto.Explorer application using Programs and Features (appwiz.cpl)

2.	First just try running CleanOnlineAppCache, then try the install again. From elevated CMD: 

    rundll32 %windir%\system32\dfshim.dll CleanOnlineAppCache

Try installing again from one of the [installation mirrors](#getting-the-tool)

3.	If it still fails, delete the local ClickOnce store. Any ClickOnce apps will reinstall automatically the next time you run them, as long as you have access to the original install location stored in the app shortcut. App shortcuts would not be deleted.

From elevated CMD:

    rd /q /s %userprofile%\appdata\local\apps\2.0

Try installing again from one of the [installation mirrors](#getting-the-tool)

4.	If it still fails, remove temp deployment files and rename the Kusto.Explorer local AppData folder.

From elevated CMD:

    rd /s/q "C:\Users\clandis\AppData\Local\Temp\Deployment"
    ren %LOCALAPPDATA%\Kusto.Explorer Kusto.Explorer.bak

Try installing again from one of the [installation mirrors](#getting-the-tool)

5.	To restore your connections from Kusto.Explorer.bak, from elevated CMD, run:

    copy %LOCALAPPDATA%\Kusto.Explorer.bak\User*.xml %LOCALAPPDATA%\Kusto.Explorer

6.	If it still fails, enable verbose ClickOnce logging by creating a LogVerbosityLevel string value of 1 under:

`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Deployment`, repro it again, and send the verbose output to 
KustoOps@microsoft.com. 

#### ClickOnce error: Your administrator has blocked this application because it potentially poses a security risk to your computer

*Symptom:*  
Program fails to install with either of the following errors:
- `Your administrator has blocked this application because it potentially poses a security risk to your computer`.
- `Your security settings do not allow this application to be installed on your computer.`

*Solution:*
1. This could be due to another application overriding the default ClickOnce trust prompt behavior.

2. You can view your default configuration settings, compare them to the actual ones on your machine, and reset them as necessary, as explained [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/deployment/how-to-configure-the-clickonce-trust-prompt-behavior).
