# Extents (Data shards) Management

## Extents Commands 

Data shards are called **extents** in Kusto, and all commands use "extent"
or "extents" as a synonym.

### .show extents

**Cluster Level**

`.show` `cluster` `extents` [`hot`]

Shows information about extents (data shards) that are present in the cluster.
If `hot` is specified - shows only extents which are expected to be in the hot cache.

**Database Level**

`.show` `database` *DatabaseName* `extents` [`(`*ExtentId1*`,`...`,`*ExtentIdN*`)`] [`hot`] [`where` `tags` (`has`|`contains`|`!has`|`!contains`) *Tag1* [`and` `tags` (`has`|`contains`|`!has`|`!contains`) *Tag2*...]]

Shows information about extents (data shards) that are present in the specified database.
If `hot` is specified - shows only extents which expected to be in the hot cache.

**Table Level**

`.show` `table` *TableName* `extents` [`(`*ExtentId1*`,`...`,`*ExtentIdN*`)`] [`hot`] [`where` `tags` (`has`|`contains`|`!has`|`!contains`) *Tag1* [`and` `tags` (`has`|`contains`|`!has`|`!contains`) *Tag2*...]]

`.show` `tables` `(`*TableName1*`,`...`,`*TableNameN*`)` `extents` [`(`*ExtentId1*`,`...`,`*ExtentIdN*`)`] [`hot`] [`where` `tags` (`has`|`contains`|`!has`|`!contains`) *Tag1* [`and` `tags` (`has`|`contains`|`!has`|`!contains`) *Tag2*...]]

Shows information about extents (data shards) that are present in the specified table(s) (the database is taken from the command's context).
If `hot` is specified - shows only extents which expected to be in the hot cache.

**NOTES**

* Using database and/or table level commands is much faster than filtering (adding `| where DatabaseName == '...' and TableName == '...'`)
the results of a cluster-level command.
* If the optional list of extent IDs is provided, the returned data set is limited to those
  extents only.
    * Again, this is much faster than filtering (adding `| where ExtentId in(...)` to) the results of "bare" commands.
* In case `tags` filters are specified:
  * The returned list is limited to those extents whose tags collection obeys *all* of the provided tags filters.
    * Again, this is much faster than filtering (adding `| where Tags has '...' and Tags contains '...'`) the results of "bare" commands.
  * `has` filters are equality filters: extents which aren't tagged with either of the specified tags will be 
  filtered out.
  * `!has` filters are equality negative filters: extents which are tagged with either of the specified tags will be 
  filtered out.
  * `contains` filters are case-insensitive substring filters: extents which don't have the specified strings 
  as a substring of any of their tags will be filtered out. 
  * `!contains` filters are case-insensitive substring negative filters: extents which have the specified strings 
  as a substring of any of their tags will be filtered out. 
  
  * **Examples**
    * Extent `E` in table `T` is tagged with tags `aaa`, `BBB` and `ccc`.
    * This query will return `E`: 
    
    ```kusto 
    .show table T extents where tags has 'aaa' and tags contains 'bb' 
    ``` 
    
    * This query will *not* return `E` (as it is not tagged with a tag which is equal to `aa`):
    
    ```kusto 
    .show table T extents where tags has 'aa' and tags contains 'bb' 
    ``` 
    
    * This query will return `E`: 
    
    ```kusto 
    .show table T extents where tags contains 'aaa' and tags contains 'bb' 
    ```

| render timechart

// Show data size distribution by table 
.show database MyDatabase extents | summarize sum(OriginalSize) by TableName

// Show all extents in the database named 'GamesDB' 
.show database GamesDB extents

// Show all extents in the table named 'Games' 
.show table Games extents

// Show all extents in the tables named 'TaggingGames1' and 'TaggingGames2', tagged with both 'tag1' and 'tag2' 
.show tables (TaggingGames1,TaggingGames2) extents where tags has 'tag1' and tags has 'tag2'
``` 
 


### .move extents

**Syntax**

`.move` `[async]` `extents` `all` `from` `table` *SourceTableName* `to` `table` *DestinationTableName*

`.move` `[async]` `extents` `(` *GUID1* [`,` *GUID2* ...] `)` `from` `table` *SourceTableName* `to` `table` *DestinationTableName* 

`.move` `[async]` `extents` `to` `table` *DestinationTableName* <| *query*

This command runs in the context of a specific database, and moves the specified extents from the source table to the destination table transactionally.
Requires [Table admin permission](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) for the source and destination tables.

* `async` (optional) specifies whether or not the command is executed asynchronously (in which case, an Operation ID (Guid) is returned,
  and the operation's status can be monitored using the [.show operations](./diagnostics.md#show-operations) command).

There are three ways to specify which extents to move:
1. All extents of a specific table are to be moved.
2. By explicitly specifying the extent IDs in the source table.
3. By providing a query whose results specify the extent IDs in the source table(s).

**Restrictions**
- Both source and destination tables must be in the context database. 
- All columns in the source table are expected to exist in the destination table with the same name and data type.

**Specifying Extents with a Query**

```kusto 
.move extents to table TableName <| ...query... 
```

The extents are specified using a Kusto query that returns a recordset with a column called "ExtentId". 

**Return output** (for sync execution)

Output parameter |Type |Description 
---|---|---
OriginalExtentId |string |A unique identifier (GUID) for the original extent in the source table, which has been moved to the destination table. 
ResultExtentId |string |A unique identifier (GUID) for the result extent which has been moved from the source table to the destination table. Upon failure - "Failed"

**Examples**

Moves all extents in table `MyTable` to table `MyOtherTable`.
```kusto
.move extents all from table MyTable to table MyOtherTable
```

Moves 2 specific extents (by their extent IDs) from table `MyTable` to table `MyOtherTable`.
```kusto
.move extents (AE6CD250-BE62-4978-90F2-5CB7A10D16D7,399F9254-4751-49E3-8192-C1CA78020706) from table MyTable to table MyOtherTable
```

Moves all extents from 2 specific tables (`MyTable1`, `MyTable2`) to table `MyOtherTable`.
```kusto
.move extents to table MyOtherTable <| .show tables (MyTable1,MyTable2) extents
```

**Example output** 

|OriginalExtentId |ResultExtentId 
|---|---
|e133f050-a1e2-4dad-8552-1f5cf47cab69 |0d96ab2d-9dd2-4d2c-a45e-b24c65aa6687

### .drop extents

Drops extents from specified database / table. 
This command has several variants: In one variant the extents to be dropped are specified by a Kusto query, whereas in 
the other variants extents are specified using a mini-language described below. 
 
#### Specifying Extents with a Query

Requires [Table admin permission](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) foreach of the tables which have extents returned by the provided query.

Drops extents (or just reports them without actually dropping if `whatif` is used):

**Syntax**

`.drop` `extents` [`whatif`] <| *query*

The extents are specified using a Kusto query that returns a recordset with a column called "ExtentId". 
 
#### Dropping a specific extent

Requires [Table admin permission](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) in case table name is specified.

Requires [Database admin permission](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) in case table name isn't specified.

**Syntax**

`.drop` `extent` *ExtentId* [`from` *TableName*]

#### Dropping specific multiple extents

Requires [Table admin permission](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) in case table name is specified.

Requires [Database admin permission](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) in case table name isn't specified.

**Syntax**

`.drop` `extents` `(`*ExtentId1*`,`...*ExtentIdN*`)` [`from` *TableName*]

#### Specifying Extents by Properties

Requires [Table admin permission](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) in case table name is specified.

Requires [Database admin permission](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) in case table name isn't specified.

`.drop` `extents` [`older` *N* (`days` | `hours`)] `from` (*TableName* | `all` `tables`) [`trim` `by` (`extentsize` | `datasize`) *N* (`MB` | `GB` | `bytes`)] [`limit` *LimitCount*]

* `older`: Only extents older than *N* days/hours will be dropped. 
* `trim`: The operation will trim the data in the database until the sum of extents matches the desired size (MaxSize) 
* `limit`: The operation will be applied to first *LimitCount* extents 

The command supports emulation (`.drop-pretend` instead of `.drop`) mode, which produces an output as if command would have run, 
but without actually executing it.

**Examples**

Remove all extents created more than 10 days ago from all tables in database `MyDatabase`

```kusto
.drop extents <| .show database MyDatabase extents | where CreatedOn < now() - time(10d)
```

Removes all extents in tables `Table1` and `Table2`, whose creation time was over 10 days ago:

```kusto
.drop extents older 10 days from tables (Table1, Table2)
```

Emulation mode: shows which extents would be removed by the command (extent ID parameter is not applicable for this command):

```kusto
.drop-pretend extents older 10 days from all tables
```

Removes all extents from 'TestTable':

```kusto
.drop extents from TestTable
```
 
**Return output**

|Output parameter |Type |Description 
|---|---|---
|ExtentId |String |ExtentId that was dropped as a result of the command 
|TableName |String |Table name, where extent belonged  
|CreatedOn |DateTime |Timestamp that holds information about when extent was initially created 
 
**Example output** 

|Extent Id |Table Name |Created On 
|---|---|---
|43c6e03f-1713-4ca7-a52a-5db8a4e8b87d |TestTable |2015-01-12 12:48:49.4298178 

### .replace extents

**Syntax**

`.replace` `[async]` `extents` `in` `table` *DestinationTableName* `<| 
{`*query for extents to be dropped from table*`},{`*query for extents to be moved to table*`}`

This command runs in the context of a specific database, 
moves the specified extents from their source tables to the destination table,
and drops the specified extents from the destination table.
All of the drop and move operations are done transactionally.

Requires [Table admin permission](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) for the source and destination tables.

* `async` (optional) specifies whether or not the command is executed asynchronously (in which case, an Operation ID (Guid) is returned,
  and the operation's status can be monitored using the [.show operations](./diagnostics.md#show-operations) command).

Specifying which extents should be dropped or moved is done by providing 2 queries
- *query for extents to be dropped from table* - the results of this query specify the extent IDs  
that should be dropped from the destination table.
- *query for extents to be moved to table* - the results of this query specify the extent IDs in the source table(s) 
that should be moved to the destination table.

Both queries should return a recordset with a column called "ExtentId". 

**Restrictions**
- Both source and destination tables must be in the context database. 
- All extents specified by the *query for extents to be dropped from table* are expected to belong to the destination table.
- All columns in the source tables are expected to exist in the destination table with the same name and data type.

**Return output** (for sync execution)

Output parameter |Type |Description 
---|---|---
OriginalExtentId |string |A unique identifier (GUID) for the original extent in the source table, which has been moved to the destination table, or - the extent in the destination table, which has been dropped.
ResultExtentId |string |A unique identifier (GUID) for the result extent which has been moved from the source table to the destination table, or - empty, in case the extent was dropped from the destination table. Upon failure - "Failed"

**Examples**

Moves all extents from 2 specific tables (`MyTable1`, `MyTable2`) to table `MyOtherTable`, and drops all extents in `MyOtherTable` 
tagged with `drop-by:MyTag`:
```kusto
.replace extents in table MyOtherTable <|
    {.show table 'MyOtherTable' extents where tags has 'drop-by:MyTag'},
    {.show tables (MyTable1,MyTable2) extents}
```

**Example output** 

|OriginalExtentId |ResultExtentId 
|---|---
|e133f050-a1e2-4dad-8552-1f5cf47cab69 |0d96ab2d-9dd2-4d2c-a45e-b24c65aa6687 
|cdbeb35b-87ea-499f-b545-defbae091b57 |a90a303c-8a14-4207-8f35-d8ea94ca45be 
|4fcb4598-9a31-4614-903c-0c67c286da8c |97aafea1-59ff-4312-b06b-08f42187872f
|2dfdef64-62a3-4950-a130-96b5b1083b5a |0fb7f3da-5e28-4f09-a000-e62eb41592df 



## Extent Tags

### .drop extent tags

**Syntax**

`.drop` `extent` `tags` `from` `table` *TableName* `(`'*Tag1*'[`,`'*Tag2*'`,`...`,`'*TagN*']`)`

`.drop` `extent` `tags` <| *query*

The command runs in the context of a specific database, and drops the provided [extent tag(s)](extents-overview.md#extent-tagging) from any extent in the provided database and table, which includes any of the tags.  

There are two ways to specify which tags should be removed from which extents:

1. By explicitly specifying the tags which should be removed from all extents in the specified table.
2. By providing a query whose results specify the extent IDs in the table and foreach extent - the tags which should be removed.

**Restrictions**
- All extents must be in the context database, and must belong to the same table. 

**Specifying Extents with a Query**

Requires [Table admin permission](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) for all involved source and destination tables.

```kusto 
.drop extent tags <| ...query... 
```

The extents and the tags to drop are specified using a Kusto query that returns a recordset with a column called "ExtentId" and a column called "Tags". 

*NOTE*: When using the [Kusto client library](../api/netfx/about-kusto-data.md), you can use the following methods in order to generate the desired command:
- `CslCommandGenerator.GenerateExtentTagsDropByRegexCommand(string tableName, string regex)`
- `CslCommandGenerator.GenerateExtentTagsDropBySubstringCommand(string tableName, string substring)`

**Return output**

Output parameter |Type |Description 
---|---|---
OriginalExtentId |string |A unique identifier (GUID) for the original extent whose tags have been modified (and is dropped as part of the operation) 
ResultExtentId |string |A unique identifier (GUID) for the result extent which has modified tags (and is created and added as part of the operation). Upon failure - "Failed"
ResultExtentTags |string |The collection of tags which the result extent is tagged with (if any remain) 

**Examples**

Drops the `drop-by:Partition000` tag from any extent in table `MyOtherTable` which is tagged with it.
```kusto
.drop extent tags from table MyOtherTable ('drop-by:Partition000')
```

Drops the tags `drop-by:20160810104500`, `a random tag`, and/or `drop-by:20160810` from any extent in table `My Table` which is tagged with either of them.
```kusto
.drop extent tags from table [My Table] ('drop-by:20160810104500','a random tag','drop-by:20160810')
```

Drops all `drop-by` tags from extents in table `MyTable`.
```kusto
.drop extent tags <| 
  .show table MyTable extents 
  | where Tags != '' 
  | extend Tags = split(Tags, '\r\n') 
  | mvexpand Tags 
  | where Tags startswith 'drop-by'
```

Drops all tags matching regex `drop-by:StreamCreationTime_20160915(\d{6})` from extents in table `MyTable`.
```kusto
.drop extent tags <| 
  .show table MyTable extents 
  | where Tags != '' 
  | extend Tags = split(Tags, '\r\n')
  | mvexpand Tags 
  | where Tags matches regex @"drop-by:StreamCreationTime_20160915(\d{6})"
```

**Example output** 

|OriginalExtentId |ResultExtentId | ResultExtentTags 
|---|---|---
|e133f050-a1e2-4dad-8552-1f5cf47cab69 |0d96ab2d-9dd2-4d2c-a45e-b24c65aa6687 | Partition001

### .alter extent tags

**Syntax**

`.alter` `extent` `tags` `(`'*Tag1*'[`,`'*Tag2*'`,`...`,`'*TagN*']`)` <| *query*

The command runs in the context of a specific database, and alters the [extent tag(s)](extents-overview.md#extent-tagging)
of all of the extents returned by the specified query, to the provided set of tags.

The extents and the tags to alter are specified using a Kusto query that returns a recordset with a column called "ExtentId".

Requires [Table admin permission](../management/access-control/role-based-authorization.md) for all involved tables.

**Restrictions**
- All extents must be in the context database, and must belong to the same table. 

**Return output**

Output parameter |Type |Description 
---|---|---
OriginalExtentId |string |A unique identifier (GUID) for the original extent whose tags have been modified (and is dropped as part of the operation) 
ResultExtentId |string |A unique identifier (GUID) for the result extent which has modified tags (and is created and added as part of the operation). Upon failure - "Failed"
ResultExtentTags |string |The collection of tags which the result extent is tagged with 

**Examples**

Alters tags of all the extents in table `MyTable` to `MyTag`.
```kusto
.alter extent tags ('MyTag') <| .show table MyTable extents
```

Alters tags of all the extents in table `MyTable`, tagged with `drop-by:MyTag` to `drop-by:MyNewTag` and `MyOtherNewTag`.
```kusto
.alter extent tags ('drop-by:MyNewTag','MyOtherNewTag') <| .show table MyTable extents where tags has 'drop-by:MyTag'
```

**Example output** 

|OriginalExtentId |ResultExtentId | ResultExtentTags
