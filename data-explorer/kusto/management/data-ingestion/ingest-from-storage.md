# The .ingest into command (pull data from storage)

The `.ingest into` command ingests data into a table by "pulling" the data
from one or more cloud storage artifacts.
For example, the command
can retrieve 1000 CSV-formatted blobs from Azure Blob Storage, parse
them, and ingest them together into a single target table.
Data is appended to the table
without affecting existing records, and without modifying the table's schema.

**Syntax**

`.ingest` [`async`] `into` `table` *TableName* *SourceDataLocator* [`with` `(` *IngestionPropertyName* `=` *IngestionPropertyValue* [`,` ...] `)`]

**Arguments**

* `async`: If specified, the command will return immediately, and continue
  ingestion in the background. The results of the command will include
  an `OperationId` value that can then be used with the `.show operation`
  command to retrieve the ingestion completion status and results.
  
* *TableName*: The name of the table to ingest data to.
  The table name is always relative to the database in context,
  and its schema is the schema that will be assumed for the data
  if no schema mapping object is provided.

* *SourceDataLocator*: A literal of type `string`, or a comma-delimited list of such
  literals surrounded by `(` and `)` characters, indicating the storage artifacts
  containing the data to pull. See [storage connection strings](../../api/connection-strings/storage.md).

> [!NOTE]
> It is strongly recommended to use [obfuscated string literals](../../query/scalar-data-types/string.md#obfuscated-string-literals)
> for the *SourceDataPointer* that includes actual credentials in it.
> The service will be sure to scrub credentials
> in its internal traces, error messages, etc.

* *IngestionPropertyName*, *IngestionPropertyValue*: Any number of
  [ingestion properties](./index.md#ingestion-properties) that affect the ingestion process.

**Results**

The result of the command is a table with as many records
as there are data shards ("extents") generated by the command.
If no data shards have been generated, a single record is returned
with an empty (zero-valued) extent ID.

|Name       |Type      |Description                                                                |
|-----------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|ExtentId   |`guid`    |The unique identifier for the data shard that was generated by the command.|
|ItemLoaded |`string`  |One or more storage artifacts that are related to this record.             |
|Duration   |`timespan`|How long it took to perform ingestion.                                     |
|HasErrors  |`bool`    |Whether this record represents an ingestion failure or not.                |
|OperationId|`guid`    |A unique ID representing the operation. Can be used with the `.show operation` command.|

**Remarks**

This command does not modify the schema of the table being ingested into.
If necessary, the data is "coerced" into this schema during ingestion,
not the other way around (extra columns are ignored, and missing columns
are treated as null values).
