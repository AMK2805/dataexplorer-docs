# Journal

 `Journal` contains information about metadata operations performed on the Kusto database.

The metadata operations could be a result of control command executed by user or internal control commands executed by the system (like drop extents by retention).

**Notes:**

- Metadata operations which encompass *adding* new extents (like `.ingest`, `.append`, `.move` and others) will not have matching events shown in the `Journal`.
- The data in the columns of the result-set, as well as the format in which it is presented, are *not* contractcual, and thus taking a dependency on them is *not* recommended.
