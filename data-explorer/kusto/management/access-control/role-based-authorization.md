# Role-based Authorization in Kusto

**Authorization** is the process of allowing or disallowing a security principal permission to carry out an action.
Kusto uses a **role-based access control** model, under which authenticated principals are mapped to **roles**, and get access according to the roles they're assigned.

The **Kusto Engine** service has the following roles:

|Role                       |Permissions                                                                                                                                                  |
