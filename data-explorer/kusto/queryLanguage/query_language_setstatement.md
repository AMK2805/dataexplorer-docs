# Set statement

The `set` statement is used to set a query option for the duration of the query.
Query options control how a query executes and returns results. They can be
Boolean flags (off by default), or have some integer value. A query may contain
zero, one, or more set statements. Set statements affect only the tabular expression
statements that trail them in program order.

> Query options can also be enabled programmatically, by setting them in the
  `ClientRequestProperties` object. See TBD.
  
> Query options are not formally a part of the Azure Log Analytics language, and may be
  modified without being considered as a breaking language change.
