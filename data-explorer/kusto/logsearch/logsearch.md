## Look how we’ve grown - Log Search editor is now multi-line

Now that you’re using the new query language, we noticed your queries no longer fit into just one line, so we decided to make log search a **multi-line editing area**.

Let’s see what’s changed:
<br/>
<li>**Run**: To run the query, click the "search" icon or use the keyboard shortcut *Shift+Enter*. *Enter* no longer runs the query, as it's now a valid character you can use as part of a query, to add lines and make it more readable.</li>
<li>**Resize**: The editing area start off with 5 lines. You can click and drag the mark on the bottom right corner to adjust the size to your needs.</li>
<li>**Intellisense**: As you type, Intellisense suggestions appear beneath the editing area. To reach the suggestions area, click *Tab*. If the cursor is on the last row of your query, the ↓ key will also take you there. 
Once you've found the best suggestion, click *Enter* to accept it and continue editing.</li>
