# Errors in native code

The Kusto engine is written in native code and reports errors by using negative `HRESULT` values. These errors aren't usually seen with a programmatic API, but may occur. For example, operation failures may depict
a status of "`Exception from HRESULT:` *HRESULT-CODE*".

Kusto native error codes are defined using Windows
`MAKE-HRESULT` macro with:

* Severity set to `1`
* Facility set to `0xDA`
  
The following error codes are defined:

|Manifest constant                  |Code |Value        |Meaning                                                                                                        |
