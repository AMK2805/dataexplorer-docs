## Virtual Network deployment

Azure Data Explorer supports deploying a cluster into a subnet in your Virtual Network (VNet), enabling you to:
* Enforce Network Security Group (NSG) rules on your ADX cluster traffic.
* Connect your on-premise network to ADX cluster's subnet.
* Secure your Data Connection sources (EventHub/EventGrid) with service endpoints.

Azure Data Explorer cluster has the following IP addresses for each service (Engine and Data Management service):
* Private IP: Used for accessing the cluster inside the VNet.
* Public IP: Used for accessing the cluster from outside the VNet (e.g. management and monitoring) and as a source address for outbound connections initiated from the cluster.
