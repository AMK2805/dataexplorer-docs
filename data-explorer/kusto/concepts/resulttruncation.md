# Query result set has exceeded the internal ... limit

A *query result set has exceeded the internal ... limit* is a kind of
[partial query failure](partialqueryfailures.md) that happens when the
query's result has exceeded one of two limits:
* A limit on the number of records (`record count limit`, set by default to
  500,000).
* A limit on the total amount of data (`data size limit`, set by default
to  67,108,864 (64MB)). 

There are several possible courses of action when this happens:
* Change the query to consume fewer resources. For example, you can try to limit the number of
  records returned by the query (using the [take operator](../query/takeoperator.md)
  or by adding additional [where clauses](../query/whereoperator.md)),
  or reduce the number of columns returned by the query (using either the
  [project operator](../query/projectoperator.md)
  or the [project-away operator](../query/projectawayoperator.md)),
  or use the [summarize operator](../query/summarizeoperator.md)
  to get aggregated data, etc.
* Increase the relevant query limit temporarily for that query
  (see **Result truncation** under [query limits](querylimits.md)).  
  Note that this is not recommended in general, as the limits exist to protect 
  the cluster specifically to make sure that a single query doesn't disrupt 
  concurrent queries running on the cluster.
