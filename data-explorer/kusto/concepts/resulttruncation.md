# Query result set has exceeded the internal ... limit

A *query result set has exceeded the internal ... limit* is a kind of
[partial query failure](partialqueryfailures.md) that happens when the
query's result has exceeded one of two limits:
* A limit on the number of records (`record count limit`, set by default to
  500,000)
* A limit on the total amount of data (`data size limit`, set by default
to  67,108,864 (64MB))

There are several possible courses of action:

* Change the query to consume fewer resources. 
  For example, you can:
  * Try to limit the number of records returned by the query. Use the [take operator](../query/takeoperator.md) or add additional [where clauses](../query/whereoperator.md)
  * Try to reduce the number of columns returned by the query. Use the [project operator](../query/projectoperator.md), or the [project-away operator](../query/projectawayoperator.md))
  * Try to use the [summarize operator](../query/summarizeoperator.md) to get aggregated data
  * and so on

* Increase the relevant query limit temporarily for that query. For more information, see **Result truncation** under [query limits](querylimits.md))

 > [!NOTE] 
 > We don't recommend that you increase the query limit, since the limits exist to protect the cluster. The limits make sure that a single query doesn't disrupt concurrent queries running on the cluster.
