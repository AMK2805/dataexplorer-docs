# Use one-click ingestion to ingest CSV data from a container to a new table in Azure Data Explorer

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [Ingest CSV data from a container to a new table](one-click-ingestion-new-table.md)
> * [Ingest JSON data from a local file to an existing table](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md)

[One-click ingestion](ingest-data-one-click.md) enables you to quickly ingest data in JSON, CSV, and other formats into a table and easily create mapping structures. The data can be ingested either from storage, from a local file, or from a container, as a one-time or continuous ingestion process.  

This document describes using the intuitive one-click wizard in a specific use case to ingest **CSV** data from a **container** into a **new table**. After ingestion, you can [set up an Event Grid ingestion pipeline](#create-continuous-ingestion-for-container) that that listens for new files in the source container and ingests qualifying data into your new table. You can use the same process with slight adaptations to cover a variety of different use cases.

For an overview of one-click ingestion and a list of prerequisites, see [One-click ingestion](ingest-data-one-click.md).
For information about ingesting data into an existing table in Azure Data Explorer, see [One-click ingestion to an existing table](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md)

## Ingest new data

1. In the left menu of the Web UI, right-click a *database* and select **Ingest new data**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/one-click-ingestion-in-web-ui.png" alt-text="Ingest new data":::

1. In the **Ingest new data** window, the **Source** tab is selected. The **Cluster** and **Database** fields are automatically populated.

    [!INCLUDE [one-click-cluster](includes/one-click-cluster.md)]

1. Select **Table** > **Create new** and enter a name for the new table. You can use alphanumeric, hyphens, and underscores. Special characters aren't supported.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Table names must be between 1 and 1024 characters.

    :::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/create-new-table.png" alt-text="Create a new table one click ingestion":::

## Select an ingestion type

Under **Source type**, do the following steps:
   
  1. Select **From blob container** (blob container, ADLS Gen1 container, ADLS Gen2 container). You can ingest up to 1000 blobs from a single container.
  1. In the **Link to storage** field, add the [SAS URL](/azure/vs-azure-tools-storage-explorer-blobs#get-the-sas-for-a-blob-container) of the container, and optionally enter the sample size. To ingest from a folder within this container, see [Ingest from folder in a container](#ingest-from-folder-in-a-container).

      :::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/from-container.png" alt-text="One-click ingestion from container":::

     > [!TIP] 
     > For ingestion **from file**, see [Use one-click ingestion to ingest JSON data from a local file to an existing table in Azure Data Explorer](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md#select-an-ingestion-type)

### Ingest from folder in a container

To ingest from a specific folder within a container, generate a string of the following format:

*container_path*`/`*folder_path*`;`*access_key_1*

You'll use this string instead of the SAS URL in [select an ingestion type](#select-an-ingestion-type).

1. Navigate to the storage account, and select **Storage Explorer > Select Blob Containers**

    :::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/blob-containers.png" alt-text="Screenshot access blob containers in Azure Storage account":::

1. Browse to the selected folder, and select **Copy URL**. Paste this value into a temporary file and add `;` to the end of this string.

    :::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/copy-url.png" alt-text="Screenshot of copy URL in folder in blob container - Azure Storage account":::

1. On the left menu under **Settings**, select **Access keys**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/copy-key-1.png" alt-text="screenshot of Access keys storage account copy Key string":::

1. Under **key 1**, copy the **Key** string. Paste this value at the end of your string from step 2. 

### Storage subscription error

If you get the following error message when ingesting from a storage account:

> Couldn't find the storage under your selected subscriptions. Please add the storage account *`storage_account_name`* subscription to your selected subscriptions in the portal.

1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="media/ingest-data-one-click/directory-subscription-icon.png" border="false":::  icon from the top right menu tray. A **Directory + subscription** pane opens.

1. In the **All subscriptions** dropdown, add your storage account's subscription to the selected list. 

    :::image type="content" source="media/ingest-data-one-click/subscription-dropdown.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Directory + subscription pane with subscription dropdown highlighted by a red box.":::

## Sample data

A sample of the data appears. If you want to, filter the data to ingest only files that begin end with specific characters. When you adjust the filters, the preview automatically updates.

For example, filter for all files that begin with the word *.csv* extension.

:::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/from-container-with-filter.png" alt-text="One click ingestion filter":::

The system will select one of the files at random and the schema will be generated based on that  **Schema defining file**. You can select a different file.

## Edit the schema

Select **Edit schema** to view and edit your table column configuration.  By looking at the name of the source, the service automatically identifies if it is compressed or not.

In the **Schema** tab:

   1. Select **Data format**:

        In this case, the data format is **CSV**

        > [!TIP]
        > If you want to use **JSON** files, see [Use one-click ingestion to ingest JSON data from a local file to an existing table in Azure Data Explorer](one-click-ingestion-existing-table.md#edit-the-schema).

   1. You can select the check box **Include column names** to ignore the heading row of the file.

        :::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/non-json-format.png" alt-text="Select include column names":::

In the **Mapping name** field, enter a mapping name. You can use alphanumeric characters and underscores. Spaces, special characters, and hyphens aren't supported.

:::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/table-mapping.png" alt-text="Table mapping name One Click Ingestion":::

### Edit the table

When ingesting to a new table, alter various aspects of the table when creating the table.

[!INCLUDE [data-explorer-one-click-column-table](includes/data-explorer-one-click-column-table.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> For tabular formats, you canâ€™t map a column twice. To map to an existing column, first delete the new column.

[!INCLUDE [data-explorer-one-click-command-editor](includes/data-explorer-one-click-command-editor.md)]

## Start ingestion

Select **Start ingestion** to create a table and mapping and to begin data ingestion.

:::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/start-ingestion.png" alt-text="Start ingestion One Click Ingestion":::

## Complete data ingestion

In the **Data ingestion completed** window, all three steps will be marked with green check marks when data ingestion finishes successfully.

:::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/one-click-data-ingestion-complete.png" alt-text="One click ingestion complete"::: 

[!INCLUDE [data-explorer-one-click-ingestion-query-data](includes/data-explorer-one-click-ingestion-query-data.md)]

## Create continuous ingestion for container

Continuous ingestion enables you to create an Event Grid that listens for new files in the source container. Any new file that meets the criteria of the pre-defined parameters (prefix, suffix, and so on) will be automatically ingested into the destination table. 

1. Select **Event Grid** in the **Continuous ingestion** tile to open the Azure portal. The data connection page opens with the event grid data connector opened and with source and target parameters already entered (source container, tables, and mappings).
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/one-click-ingestion-new-table/continuous-button.png" alt-text="continuous ingestion button":::

1. Select **Create** to create a data connection which will listen for any changes, updates, or new data in that container.
