## Authentication

To run the following example, you need an Azure AD Application and service principal that can access resources. See [create an Azure AD application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) to create a free Azure AD Application and add role assignment at the subscription level. You also need the `Directory (tenant) ID`, `Application ID`, and `Client Secret`.
