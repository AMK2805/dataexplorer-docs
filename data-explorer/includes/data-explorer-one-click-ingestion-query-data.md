## Quick queries and tools

In the right-hand menu, select **Quick queries** or **Tools**: 
   * **Quick queries** includes links to the Web UI with example queries.
   * **Tools** includes a link to **Drop commands** on the Web UI, which enable you to troubleshoot issues by running the relevant `.drop` commands.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You might lose data when you use `.drop` commands. Use them carefully.
   > Drop commands will only revert the changes that were made by this ingestion flow (new extents and columns). Nothing else will be dropped.
