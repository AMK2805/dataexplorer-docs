# Quickstart: Visualize data using the Azure Data Explorer connector for Power BI

Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. Power BI is a business analytics solution that lets you visualize your data and share the results across your organization.

Azure Data Explorer provides three options for connecting to data in Power BI: use the built-in connector, import a query from Azure Data Explorer, or use a SQL query. This quickstart shows you how to use the built-in connector to get data and visualize it in a Power BI report.

If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

You need the following to complete this quickstart:

* An organizational email account that is a member of Azure Active directory, so you can connect to the [Azure Data Explorer help cluster](https://dataexplorer.azure.com/clusters/help/databases/samples).
