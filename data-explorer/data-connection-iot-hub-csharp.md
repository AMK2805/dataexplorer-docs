Azure Data Explorer is a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. Azure Data Explorer offers ingestion (data loading) from Event Hubs, IoT Hubs, and blobs written to blob containers. In this article, you create an IoT Hub data connection for Azure Data Explorer by using C#.

## Prerequisites

1. If you don't have Visual Studio 2019 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Make sure that you enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.

1. If you don't have an Azure subscription, create a [free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

1. [A test cluster and database](create-cluster-database-csharp.md)

1. [A test table and column mapping](net-standard-ingest-data.md#create-a-table-on-your-test-cluster)

1. [Set database and table policies](database-table-policies-csharp.md) (optional)

1. [An IoT hub with a shared access policy configured](ingest-data-iot-hub.md#create-an-iot-hub) for adding an IoT hub data connection.

## Install C# Nuget

1. Install the [Azure Data Explorer (Kusto) nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.Kusto/).

1. Install the [Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory/) for authentication.

## Authentication
To run the following example, you need an Azure AD Application and service principal that can access resources. See [create an Azure AD application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal) to create a free Azure AD Application and add role assignment at the subscription level. You also need the `Directory (tenant) ID`, `Application ID`, and `Client Secret`.

## Add an IoT Hub data connection (Preview)
The following example shows you how to add an IoT Hub data connection programmatically. See[connect Azure Data Explorer table to IoT Hub](ingest-data-iot-hub.md#connect-azure-data-explorer-table-to-iot-hub) for adding an Iot Hub data connection through the Azure portal.

```csharp
var tenantId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";//Directory (tenant) ID
var clientId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";//Application ID
var clientSecret = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxx";//Client Secret
var subscriptionId = "xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx";
var authenticationContext = new AuthenticationContext($"https://login.windows.net/{tenantId}");
var credential = new ClientCredential(clientId, clientSecret);
var result = await authenticationContext.AcquireTokenAsync(resource: "https://management.core.windows.net/", clientCredential: credential);

var credentials = new TokenCredentials(result.AccessToken, result.AccessTokenType);

var kustoManagementClient = new KustoManagementClient(credentials)
{
    SubscriptionId = subscriptionId
};

var resourceGroupName = "testrg";
//The cluster and database that are created as part of the Prerequisites
var clusterName = "mykustocluster";
var databaseName = "mykustodatabase";
var dataConnectionName = "myeventhubconnect";
//The IoT hub that is created as part of the Prerequisites
var iotHubResourceId = "/subscriptions/xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxx/resourceGroups/xxxxxx/providers/Microsoft.Devices/IotHubs/xxxxxx";
var sharedAccessPolicyName = "iothubforread";
var consumerGroup = "$Default";
var location = "Central US";
//The table and column mapping are created as part of the Prerequisites
var tableName = "StormEvents";
var mappingRuleName = "StormEvents_CSV_Mapping";
var dataFormat = DataFormat.CSV;

await kustoManagementClient.DataConnections.CreateOrUpdate(resourceGroupName, clusterName, databaseName, dataConnectionName,
            new IotHubDataConnection(iotHubResourceId, consumerGroup, sharedAccessPolicyName, tableName: tableName, location: location, mappingRuleName: mappingRuleName, dataFormat: dataFormat));
```
