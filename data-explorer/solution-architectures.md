# Solution architectures

Azure Data Explorer is a fully managed, high-performance, big data analytics platform that makes it easy to analyze high volumes of data in near real time. The Azure Data Explorer toolbox gives you an end-to-end solution for data ingestion, query, visualization, and management.

The following architectures from the [Azure Architecture Center](/azure/architecture/) present solutions for architectures involving Azure Data Explorer in various use cases.

## Big data analytics with Azure Data Explorer

This solution illustrates how Azure Data Explorer and Azure Synapse Analytics complement each other for near real-time analytics and modern data warehousing use cases.

## Azure Data Explorer interactive analytics

This solution idea demonstrates interactive analytics with Azure Data Explorer to explore data with ad hoc, interactive, and lightning fast queries over small to extremely large volumes of data. This data exploration can be done using native Azure Data Explorer tools or alternative tools of your choice. This solution focuses on the integration of Azure Data Explorer with rest of the data platform ecosystem.

## IoT analytics with Azure Data Explorer

This solution idea demonstrates near real-time analytics over fast flowing, high volume streaming data from IoT devices, sensors, connected buildings and vehicles, and so on. It focuses on integration of Azure Data Explorer with other IoT services to cater to both operational and analytical workloads using Cosmos DB and Azure Data Explorer

## Geospatial data processing and analytics

Many possibilities exist for working with geospatial data, or information that includes a geographic component. For instance, geographic information system (GIS) software and standards are widely available. These technologies can store, process, and provide access to geospatial data. But it's often hard to configure and maintain systems that work with geospatial data. You also need expert knowledge to integrate those systems with other systems.
