# Prepay for Azure Data Explorer markup units with Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity

Save money with Azure Data Explorer by prepaying for the markup units compared to pay-as-you-go prices. With Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity, you make an upfront commitment for a period of one or three years to get a significant discount on the Azure Data Explorer markup costs. To purchase Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity, you need to specify the term, it will apply to all deployments of Azure Data Explorer in all regions.


By purchasing a reservation, you are pre-paying for the markup costs for a period of one or three years. As soon as you buy a reservation, the Azure Data Explorer markup charges that match the reservation attributes are no longer charged at the pay-as-you go rates and Azure Data Explorer clusters that are already running or ones that are newly deployed, will automatically get the benefit.  This reservation does not cover compute, networking, or storage charges associated with the clusters, reserved capacity for these resources need to be purchased separately. At the end of the reservation term, the billing benefit expires and the Azure Data Explorer markup units are billed at the pay-as-you go price. Reservations do not auto-renew. For pricing information, see the [Azure Data Explorer pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/data-explorer/).

You can buy Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). To buy Azure Data Explorer reserved capacity:
