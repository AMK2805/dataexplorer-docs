# What is a "Start for free"?

The "Start for free" cluster allows anyone with a Microsoft account or an Azure Active Directory user identity to create a free Azure Data Explorer cluster without needing an Azure subscription or a credit card.

A single, free cluster can be created and used for commercial or non-commercial purposes. It is intended to provide a frictionless cluster deployment for anyone who wants to experience and enjoy the incredible performance of our engine and our productive, easy-to-learn Kusto Query Language.

The cluster's trial period is for a year and isn't included in our service level agreements, though we may automatically extend the trial period. At any time, you can upgrade the cluster to a full Azure Data Explorer license.

Start your journey by [creating you own free cluster](https://aka.ms/kustofree) and reviewing the [Microsoft Software License Terms](https://aka.ms/kustofreeeula).
